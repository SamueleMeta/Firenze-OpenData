## Overview

This web app allows to visualize the main health infrastructures located in the municipality of Florence and surrounding areas, in both desktop and mobile versions. Moreover, it allows the user to locate himself in different points of the city through the search functionality, filter the results and draw routes to the desired destinations.

## Data
All data used for the development of the web app are freely accessible as open data on the [portal of the municipality of Florence](https://opendata.comune.fi.it/?q=metarepo/categoryinfo&id=Sanit%C3%A0_sociale). It is also possible to download them in different formats, including ```xml```, ```shp``` and ```kml```. These cover a variety of services, from senior centers to pharmacies, for a total of 20 categories.

## Desktop version

</p>

The homepage is divided into two sections: one dedicated to the menu and one to the interactive map. On the left you can enable and disable the services you want to show on the map, recognizable by their color. Thanks to the search bar, for which the suggestion and auto-completion functionalities are enabled, it will be possible to center the search near every street or point of interest. Clicking on the pins on the map, a box containing more information about the structure will open.

</p>

At this point it will be possible to request a route to the destination of interest starting from the last position searched or, if active, from the geolocalized position of the device. Different itineraries will be provided in case of travel on foot, by public transport or by own car.

From the main menu it is also possible to access a customized section, depending on the service, from which the user can narrow the radius of the search and activate additional filters to refine it.

## Mobile version

The mobile version offers the user the same functionalities, but optimized for a smaller screen experience. Through gestures it will be possible to select the desired services and show them on the map, from which it will be possible to conveniently access the filters.
